djarchive-client
================

This is 'djarchive-client', a library for interfacing with DataJoint Neuro's
data publication service.

Status: WIP; currently for internal/prototyping use.

Installation & Setup
====================

Installation & Setup instructions are as follows:

  1) Install the package:

     ``$ pip install .``

  2) If applicable, configure datajoint with appropriate dj.config['custom'] 
     values:

      Admin usage expects dj.config['custom'] values for:

        - djarchive.access_key
        - djarchive.secret_key

      Client and admin usage allow overriding dj.config['custom']
      defaults for:

        - djarchive.bucket
        - djarchive.endpoint

      This should only be needed for development or custom server
      configurations.

Usage via 'djarchive' utility script
====================================

The 'djarchive' utility script can be used for CLI interactions with the
data archive. Usage synopsys is described in the following subsections.

Browsing & Retrieving Datasets
------------------------------

The following example shows a minimal usage synopsis to navigate the available
datasets and to download a single dataset.

.. code-block:: sh

  $ djarchive datasets # list datasets
  some-set
  $ djarchive revisions # list all datasets & revisions
  some-set,000
  other-set,001
  $ djarchive revisions some-set # list revisions for dataset 'some-set'
  some-set,000
  $ djarchive download some-set 000 ./some-set-000 # download some-set rev. 000

File Integrity, Download Caching & Error Handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The djarchive client provides integrity protection in the form of a
file manifest, called 'djarchive-manifest.csv', which is a CSV list
of file sizes, sha1 hashes, and file subpaths for a given dataset.

By default, files having path components beginning with '.' are not
considered for inclusion within archives. This behavior can be overridden
by setting the dj.config.filename_filter property to a regular expression
containing the desired filtering pattern, or the special string "''",
which is treated as matching the empty string ('^$') and so should never
match a file.

Retrieval of datasets begins with the download of this manifest, which
is then used to direct the remaining download and to verify download
actions complete successfullly.

To allow for resuming of partially downloaded datasets, local files in the
target directory of the download are compared against the manifest. If a
local file matches the manifest contents, it is not re-retrieved, and if
a local file does not match the manifest contents, it is re-retrieved
without confirmation.

Uploading Datasets
------------------

Datasets can be uploaded using the djarchive client using the 'upload'
functionality. In short:

.. code-block:: sh

  $ djarchive upload my-dataset 1 /path/to/my-dataset

If a djarchive manifest is not present in /path/to/my-dataset, it will
be generated as part of the upload process, with the manifest uploaded
as the last step to indicate that the dataset is complete.

If a djarchive manifest is present in /path/to/my-dataset, files will be
checked against the manifest as part of the upload process, and an error
will be signalled if files exist in the dataset folder which are not
tracked in the manifest, or if files do not match the expected manifest
values.

The djarchive manifest file can also be generated as a separate step via
the 'manifest' command:

.. code-block:: sh

  $ djarchive manifest /path/to/my-dataset

Usage via 'djarchive_client' python pacakge
===========================================

The djarchive_client python package contains the logic for interacting
with the archive. Best reference is the code/docstrings; minimal usage
example is as follows:

.. code-block:: python

  >>> from djarchive_client import client
  >>> c = client()
  >>> c.datasets()
  <generator object DJArchiveClient.datasets at 0x7faf65ec4ba0>
  >>> list(c.datasets())
  ['some-set']
  >>> c.revisions()
  <generator object DJArchiveClient.revisions at 0x7faf65ec4ba0>
  >>> list(c.revisions())
  [('some-set', '000'), ('other-set', '001')]
  >>> list(c.revisions('some-set'))
  [('some-set', '000')]
  >>> c.download('some-set', '000', './some-set-000', create_target=True)

Logging & Output
================

Functions in the djarchive_client library and the djarchive utility
currently do not produce output in the normal case.  In some cases,
such as for viewing per-file download status messages, more detailed
output may be desired.

In the script case, setting ``dj.config['loglevel']`` or the environment
variable ``DJARCHIVE_LOGLEVEl`` to ``DEBUG`` will increase logging
output. Additionally, output can be logged to a file by setting
``dj.config['custom']['logfile']`` to a string containing the path to a
desired logfile.

For library usage, setting the python logging for the ``djarchive_client``
module to ``logging.DEBUG`` will enable more verbose output. See the function
``logsetup`` in ``scripts/djarchive`` for more details.
